# flazxiv

A pixiv bookmark API for my website. Check it out in action at https://flaz.ing/liked-artworks.

## Primary Uses

- Local public bookmark tags and bookmarks replica (with sync)
    - Detects recent bookmark removals (in case I accidentally set a suspicious bookmark as public)
- Better (albeit inefficient) tag searching system (case-insensitive and supports multiple tags instead of just one on pixiv)
- Custom bookmark tag mappings (normalized tag -> a list of pixiv tags) for searching
